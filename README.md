# BookStack2Site

CLI tool which generates static sites from Bookstack Wikis.

**Usecases:** 
* Sometimes you want a BookStack wiki for personal/team use and a public facing high traffic site for everyone else.
* Offline backup of your wiki which is good looking and easy to navigate.
* You want a markdown version of your wiki synced to a Git repo.
